                        India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world, 
                        spanning a period of more than 4000 years, and witnessing 
                        the fusion of several customs and traditions, which are 
                        reflective of the rich culture and heritage of the Country.
                </p>
                <p>
                        The history of the nation gives a glimpse into the 
                        magnanimity of its evolution - from a Country reeling 
                        under colonialism, to one of the leading economies 
                        in the global scenario within a span of fifty years. 
                        More than anything, the nationalistic fervour of the 
                        people is the contributing force behind the culmination 
                        of such a development. 
                        This transformation of the nation instills a sense 
                        of national pride in the heart of every Indian 
                        within the Country and abroad, and this section 
                        is a modest attempt at keeping its flame alive.

                    <h2>People & Lifestyle </h2>
                    <h4>Lifestyle, Values & Beliefs </h4>
                    <p>
                        India is a diverse country, a fact that is visibly prominent
                        in its people, culture and climate. From the eternal snows 
                        of the Himalayas to the cultivated peninsula of far South, from 
                        the deserts of the West to the humid deltas of the East, from 
                        the dry heat and cold of the Central Plateau to the cool forest 
                        foothills, Indian lifestyles clearly glorify the geography.</br>
                        The food, clothing and habits of an Indian differ in accordance to the place of origin.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Culture</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Indian culture varies like its vast geography.
                        People speak in different languages, dress differently,
                        follow different religions, eat different food but are 
                        of the same temperament. So whether it is a joyous occasion
                        or a moment of grief, people participate whole-heartedly,
                            feeling the happiness or pain. A festival or a celebration is never
                            constrained to a family or a home. The whole community or neighbourhood
                            is involved in bringing liveliness to an occasion. Likewise, 
                            an Indian wedding is a celebration of union, not only of the 
                            bride and groom, but also of two families, maybe cultures or 
                            religion too! Similarly, in times of sorrow, neighbours and 
                            friends play an important part in easing out the grief.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Science</h4>
                    <p>
                        The global image of India is that of an upcoming and progressive nation. 
                        True, India has leaped many boundaries in all sectors- commerce, technology 
                        and development etc in the recent past, yet she has not neglected her other creative genius. 
                        Wondering what it is? Well, it the alternative science that has been continuously practiced in India 
                        since times immemorial. Ayurveda, is a distinct form of medicine made purely of herbs and natural weeds, 
                        that can cure any ailment of the world. Ayurveda has also been mentioned in the Ancient Indian epics 
                        like Ramayana. Even today, when the western concept of medicine has reached its zenith, there 
                        are people looking for alternative methods of treatment for its multifarious qualities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With increasing complexities in one's lives these days, people are perpetually 
                        looking for a medium through which they get some peace of mind. 
                        This is where another science, that of meditation and spirituality comes into the scene. 
                        Meditation and Yoga are synonymous with India and Indian spirituality. 
                        Meditation is one of the most important components of Yoga, which is a mind-body 
                        therapy involving a series of exercises.
                        However in Yoga, meditation generally refers to the more formal practice of focusing 
                        the mind and observing oneself in the moment. Many people from India and abroad are 
                        resorting to yoga and meditation to de-stress and rejuvenate their mind.
                        The beauty of the Indian people lies in their spirit of tolerance, 
                        give-and-take and a composition of cultures that can be compared to a garden 
                        of flowers of various colours and shades of which, while maintaining their own entity, 
                        lend harmony and beauty to the garden - India!

                    <h4>Lakshadweep Islands</h4>
                    <p>
                            Comprising a string of 36 palm-covered, 
                            white-sand-skirted coral islands 300km off 
                            the coast of Kerala, Lakshadweep is as stunning 
                            as it is isolated. Only 10 of these islands are 
                            inhabited, mostly by Sunni Muslim fishermen, 
                            and foreigners are only allowed to stay on a 
                            few of these. With fishing and coir production 
                            the main sources of income, local life on the 
                            islands remains highly traditional, and a caste 
                            system divides the islanders. The real attraction 
                            of the islands lies under the water: the 4200 sq km of 
                            pristine archipelago lagoons, unspoiled coral reefs, 
                            and warm waters are a magnet for flipper-toting travelers 
                            and divers alike.
